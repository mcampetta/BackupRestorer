# BackupRestorer
Application that wraps iMobileDeviceLib in Autohotkey to automate the process of restoreing iOS device backups onto new phones. 

iMobileDeviceLib for windows is used and the Autohotkey script is compiled for windows

iMobileDeviceLib: https://github.com/libimobiledevice-win32
Autohotkey:       https://www.autohotkey.com/

Just place the binary file alongside the iOS device backup folder. 

Example:

-f49dfa157f0e6b2f0627bb5a8b2e10711b73af7f

-BackupRestorer.exe

An run the BackupRestorer.exe application. 

More will be available as it is written. Should have a first release shortly.
